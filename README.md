Hello, my name is Miguel Torres and this is my first official website template I replicated using HTMl and CSS. Following the lessons from the Odin Project I was able to somewhat create an identical website to the one in the image provided. In retrospect I could have done some things differently but I do know its a learning process, and I have much to learn! Thank you for reading. Hopefully in the near future I will be creating many more projects with my newfound knowledge.
